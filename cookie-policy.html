  <h2 class="text-center">Our Cookie Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We care about your privacy. To maintain compliance with the European Union general Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR), the following will help you understand how and why we use
    cookies on our site, and what you can do to control how they’re used.
  </p>

  <p>These are the two kinds of cookies we use:</p>

  <br>

  <h3>Session Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    These are temporary cookies stored in your browser’s memory while you are viewing our websites. When you close your browser, these cookies and your device data are deleted.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    These are longer-term cookies that are tagged with an expiration date.
    These cookies are stored by your browser even after it’s closed. They are returned to you every time you visit our site or view a site that contains a resource (such as an ad) issued by us.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way, persistent cookies can track your activity not only on our site but also on any site that includes a resource issued by us. This is the mechanism sites like Google and Facebook use to create a log of user activity across multiple websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, when you click “Remember Me” or a similar option when logging into an online account, a persistent cookie is used to store your login information on your browser.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h3>You can control how cookies are used</h3>
  <p>
    Cookies, even bad ones from suspicious companies, aren’t viruses. The plain text nature of cookies means they cannot be executed on your computer. If you do not want us to store cookies on your behalf, please delete these cookies from your computer and/or choose to block cookies from sites like ours permanently. You may also choose to browse in Private or Incognito mode, which means no cookies will be set for your device.

    Benningfield Group wants you to know you have rights regarding how your data is used, and that we respect your wishes in this regard.
