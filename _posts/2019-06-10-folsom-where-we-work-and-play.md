We’re lucky enough to call the City of Folsom our home at BG Software. Although its name is recognizable worldwide in part because of the prison that Johnny Cash made famous – Folsom State Prison, Folsom has a rich history beginning with the ‘ 49ers during the great Gold Rush in California. It was also the site of the first railroad in the West and the first long-distance electricity transmission in the world.

Folsom today is a forward-looking high-tech city with companies ranging from small to large international corporations. Moreover, Folsom boasts excellent schools, beautiful family-oriented neighborhoods and excellent shopping, dining and cultural options.

Just a few of Folsom’s benefits are as follows:

    The General Plan of the City takes note of the family orientation of the community, calling for at least five acres of park land for every 1,000 residents, and co-sponsoring of special activities involving the whole family.
  </li>
 <li>
    “Distinctive by nature,” Folsom is home to natural amenities that provide recreational enthusiasts on land and water with a year-round playground. The city was bordered by Folsom Lake, Natoma Lake and the American River, hosting kayakers, swimmers and other water sports enthusiasts from all over the region.

    Almost every home in the city is within half a mile of a park’s radius. The city’s 46 parks are teeming with an almost limitless activity range, from cricket to lacrosse, tennis to t-ball, soccer, soccer, and more.

    Named the “Best place to raise a family in California” (WalletHub), Folsom residents take great pride in the safety and sense of community that the city provides, and the 72,000 culturally diverse residents range from young families to active retirees.
