description: "An example of our work: learn how we developed multiple databases to maintain the document repositories for the California Public Utilities Commission."

client-text: The CPUC regulates privately owned electric, natural gas, telecommunications, water, railroad, rail transit, and passenger transportation companies, in addition to authorizing video franchises. The five Governor-appointed commissioners, as well as our staff, are dedicated to ensuring that consumers have safe, reliable utility service at reasonable rates, protecting against fraud, and promoting the health of California's economy.

challenge-text: The CPUC needed to make enhancements to the Public Document Area (PDA), Contract Management System (CMS), and Project Status Reporting (PSR) sites to be more responsive to the changing needs of Energy Division staff and other users, based on the introduction of change orders to contracts and the launch of the next wave of contracts. It was also important for the CPUC to help make the growing number of documents on the PDA site more easily accessible to users, system maintenance, and user support. There was also a need to create web-based training modules for the CMS and PDA sites and to create a “best practices” section of the user guide.

technologies: [javascript, angular, bootstrap, c-sharp, mysql, docker]

outcome-text: We developed a database to maintain the document repository for the PDA, CMS, and PSR sites. For the Energy Division of the CPUC, we developed and continue to maintain a customized web-based CMS tailored to assist in tracking and managing several dozen contracts and purchase orders used to evaluate the effectiveness of the more than 200 utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs. A single login has been implemented across the CMS, PDA, and PSR sites so that users will only need one login to access any of the three sites. These internet-based systems have different permission levels, based on a user’s role in the project, along with auto notification, tallying, data import and reporting features.
