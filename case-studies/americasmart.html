    title="Modernizing the Application Process"

    challenge="For an exhibitor to participate in a show, there was a lengthy process in place
    where they would have to manually fill out a paper application, fax it in,
    complete a credit card deposit, and include a wet signature with the final
    contract. Exhibitors would have to complete this process for each show that they
    attended, and most of them would attend multiple shows a year."

    outcome="Our solution featured an integration we did with Auth.net so that AmericasMart
    could take online payments -including signing up for auto pay - and do so
    seamlessly within the application processes. We automated their prior process and
    turned it into an Online Exhibitor Portal, making both the registration and
    payment process incredibly simple for all stakeholders. Exhibitors now only need
    to sign up one time per year, regardless of how many shows they would like to
    attend. The Portal also remembers returning exhibitors, recalling which shows they
    attended in the past, booth number, locations, payment information, etc. so they
    could apply for every show, all in the same app, all at the same time."

    quote-content="“The Benningfield Group has been AmericasMart’s software development partner
    for over a decade. They produce quality mission critical software on time and on budget year after
    year. We are fortunate to benefit from their expertise.”"

    title="Inventory and Installation Management for Advertising"

    challenge="At AmericasMart, there are three main categories of advertising/promotional
    options for exhibitors: print, on-site exposure, and online exposure. For clients
    deploying sponsorship campaigns, they were assigned a unique physical location at
    the market. Historically, these locations were kept on an Excel spreadsheet, then
    transferred to a PowerPoint document, which was used to walk the different venues
    to ensure and approve that the proper advertising assets where placed in the correct
    locations."

    outcome="We built software that created a digital representation of the floor plan of the
    exhibitor areas, to ensure each promotional asset was placed properly. Our
    application also featured an image uploader, so one could see at a glance what
    was in each location, filterable based on advertising type, material etc. We took
    a previously manual promotional process and automated it, allowing AmericasMart
    employees to check promotional installations from their computers/phones. In an
    integration we did with the printing company ColorSpot, our interactive floorplan
    map saved infinite amounts of paper, time and money."

    title="Constantly Changing Floorplans"

    challenge="With over 16 shows per year, and thousands of exhibitors and buyers for each show, the floor at
    AmericasMart is always changing. It is crucial for all parties to know not only what the floor plans look like
    currently, but also what they will look like for future shows."
    
    outcome="We built a set of tools which takes AutoCAD files, identifies the layers that
    show certain required information like booth dimensions that, when uploaded, are
    saved as sets of vertices and redrawn dynamically. We built an online app to show
    what the floor plan and booth spaces would look like ahead of each event. We were
    able to create these custom floor plans by manipulating CAD files and sets of
    vertices which was also rendered on the front-end. This floorplan application
    allowed buyers to know the “address” of a booth they wanted to visit. The dynamic
    display would instantly update who moved, who is at this spot or that booth. It
    made it easy for buyers at market to get an overall look at the layout of the
    floor. Here’s an example: If someone cancelled from appearing at market their
    booth would be removed right away so buyers intending to visit it wouldn’t be
    disappointed."
