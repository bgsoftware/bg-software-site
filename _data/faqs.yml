- question : How long will it take for me to receive the results of the security audit?
  answer   : "The answer is “it depends,” but let’s try and be more specific.
              You may have only one application which needs to be audited, and
              that can usually be done quickly, generally in 2-3 business days
              after we receive the signed contract. If you have a complex set
              of applications, databases, etc. it might take longer, but we’ll
              work with you to be upfront about our process so you’ll know
              the timeline before we start."
- question : How will I receive my report?
  answer   : "We’ll send you an encrypted PDF that’s password-protected via email."
- question : Will you be looking at all my applications, or a fixed number of them?
  answer   : "During the intake process, we’ll ask a few questions about your
              situation. You may be certain one or more of your applications
              are safe and solid, so we’ll skip those and focus only on the
              ones you feel need review."
- question : Will you be looking at my emails?
  answer   : "Generally, no. If you have your own dedicated email server and
              suspect there may be some vulnerabilities, we’d be happy to look,
              but as for “reading” the content of individual emails, we have no
              interest and would not need to do that."
- question : Are you hacking me?
  answer   : "Absolutely not! You will know when we are performing the audit.
              You will be 100% in the loop—no secrets."
- question : I don’t own the software I use at my company; can you look at it?
  answer   : "If you didn’t make it yourself but you “own it,” sure, we can
              probably help. During the intake process we’ll ask those questions
              and let you know."
- question : Will you come to my business to perform the audit?
  answer   : "In most cases we perform the audit off-site. For the Comprehensive
              audit, we’ll be digging deep into your code, so the answer may be
              yes depending on your software and setup."
- question : "Do I have to use you to make any “repairs” or modifications once
              you’ve completed the audit?"
  answer   : "Our service provides you with a threat assessment and report on
              what we found. You are under no obligation to use us to make any
              suggested fixes. The deliverable from us is answers, though you may
              ask us to continue working with you and we’d be happy to discuss that."
- question : "What if you run the audit and come up with nothing? Do I still
              have to pay you?"
  answer   : "You do not. If we don’t find anything, we’ll praise you for
              being a security wizard and your audit is free."
- question : "My report is going to be full of words and phrases I don’t
              understand. How will I know how to interpret your findings?"
  answer   : "Our security experts speak two languages – computer code and
              plain English. We’ll help you make sense of the report in a
              way that gives you confidence."
