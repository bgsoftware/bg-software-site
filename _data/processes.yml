  description : "We listen to find out as much as we can about your business, target market,
                 goals and budget. This is a business meeting, designed to figure out what you
                 want and what you need. We’ll have some questions for you as well: we’ll need to
                 know who’s going to use the application, how team members would use it – things
                 like that – which will help us help you."

  description : "You want to know what it’s going to cost and the timeline to get it done. We’ll
                 move quickly to get you answers. We’ll huddle up internally and determine what we
                 believe is the size and scope of a solution. We’ll talk with subject matter
                 experts and our developers internally to come up with an initial quote."

  description : "We’ll show you a high-level breakdown of your application’s structure and offer
                 options which might work well for you. You’ll likely have more questions, and we’ll
                 address those in this meeting.  We’ll do any final sizing and scoping after that.
                 The option you like best will result in a fully researched final quote and we’ll
                 sign a contract."

  description : "A wireframe is a term in our business for the visual representation of the pages in
                 your application: Where elements go, what they do, what they’ll do next. This shows
                 you the basic structure of your application. This is the ”look and feel” part of
                 the process – at this point, you’ll be able to see not only where elements are,
                 but how they behave."

  description : "We’ve checked and confirmed features and design with you. Now, it’s time to build
                 your software! We’ve already assembled a team including a project manager, who will
                 be your main contact the rest of the way.  Our developers and design pros will be
                 the artists creating your project."

  description : "It’s quality assurance, another word for making sure it works. We test as we go,
                 checking in with you as much as you need us to. This is designed to save you time
                 and money. You’ll be a big part of the process, because your software will likely
                 have distinct and unique features. As we hit benchmarks, you’ll be able to use
                 finished parts of your application, giving us feedback"

  description : "We’ve tested it, you’ve tried it out, we’ve made changes and adjustments based on
                 your feedback.  This part of the process is typically called beta. Some or all your
                 users have participated or even practiced with the software by this point
                 internally. We put it to the test in beta mode, make any last-minute modifications,
                 and then, the fun part – taking it live."

  description : "No software is perfect 100% of the time.  It’s a lot like a car: you take care of 
                 it; it’ll take care of you. We can provide an ongoing maintenance deal with you to
                 keep you up and running.  From bug fixes to user requests to additional features,
                 we can stay with you as your partner to make sure you don’t have downtime or face
                 any security risk."
