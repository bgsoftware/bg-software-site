text: "We have worked with companies that understand they have a business need that can be solved
with software. We meet with them to discuss their current workflow and processes. We work with them
to design/craft the best possible solution, often automating processes that were previously done
manually and on paper. The software development process captures all the steps in between. Because
the business is involved in requirements gathering and available for help in the design phase, the
end product is unique and suits them. Software development doesnâ€™t have to be a big project or
application. It can be a small custom calculator on a website, adding new fields to an already
existing submittal form, or implementing a single sign-on for existing applications."
