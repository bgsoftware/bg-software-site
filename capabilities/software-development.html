subtitle: Crafting solutions to automate your process

text: 'Here at BG Software, we understand that there are many business needs that can be solved with Software.
Through meeting with our clients and discussing their current workflow and processes, we help to design/craft
the best possible solution, often
<a class="color-teal hover-color-dark-blue" href="/case-studies/americasmart">automating</a> processes that were
previously done manually and/or on paper. The software development process captures all the steps in between. Because
the business is involved in requirements gathering and available for help in the design phase, the end product is unique
and suits them. Software development doesnâ€™t have to be a big project or application. It can be a small custom
calculator on a website, adding new fields to an already existing submittal form, or implementing a single sign-on for
existing applications.'
