text: '<p>We have a lot of experience implementing Single Sign-On (SSO).</p>
<p>Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Twitter do this – we do too. It’s the act of signing in easily and quickly once to
access several different applications. We did that for our client, the
<a href="/case-studies/cpuc.html" class="color-teal hover-color-dark-blue">California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)</a>
using our own auth client as an identity provider.</p>
<p>We also understand the security details that are behind common SSO specifications. With that understanding we
can ensure your application has a robust authentication and authorization system, whether it’s implementing a Google
sign-in, or something we make specifically for your application.</p>
<p>Security is so much more than a login and a password. You’d be amazed at what black hats can do.</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping our customer’s data secure. BG Software is currently offering security audits for
businesses of all sizes – to identify and correct vulnerabilities in their applications.</p>'
