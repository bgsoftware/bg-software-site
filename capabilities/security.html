text: '<p>We have a lot of experience specifically with Single Sign On.</p>
<p>Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and many more do this; we do too. It’s the
act of signing in easily and quickly to access several different applications.</p>
<p>We did that for our client, the
<a href="/case-studies/cpuc.html" class="color-teal hover-color-dark-blue">California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)</a>.
We also know about the security details that are on the side of those specifications.
Even seasoned developers can leave things out of out of their authentication and
authorization system.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. You make a deal to work with a company, and they have a team of
developers. They’d like to access your data so that they can write their own application,
then chose, say, calendars, in their own format. How do you grant access to that
third-party application? Sometimes, if you log in to a social network you may get a
dialog that says “This app wants to access your profile, fill in your email and phone
number. Do you want to do that?” And you say, “Yes.” Now they have your email. And so
those grants are something that’s often left out of the authentication and authorization.
What we do is make sure that doesn’t happen.</p>'
