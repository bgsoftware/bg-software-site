text: "When our founder Lynn worked here, she would always say, “People don’t really realize how useful data is.” She was right. We all now understand how collecting and reporting data is critical for the success of a business. You grab it, shape it, visualize it, and plan your future with it! It’s a pretty broad umbrella term but let’s use this example. Anytime you’re storing a large amount of data, especially historical data, you want to be able to look back. For our client AmericasMart, their exhibitors sell their products, but they also sold products last year, or two or three years ago. We have all this historic data warehoused, so they can generate reports on who was there, when, and in which booth We can build you a warehouse and combine many different types of data (link to Sys Int) points as well."
