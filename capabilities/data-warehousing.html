subtitle: "The ability to access your data and build reports to learn about the habits and trends of your customers."

text: '<p>When our founder Lynn worked here, she would always say, “People don’t really realize the usefulness of
data.”</p>
<p>She was right. We all now understand how collecting and reporting data is critical for the success of a business. You
grab it, shape it, visualize it, and plan your future with it!</p>
<p>Data Warehousing is a pretty broad umbrella term but let’s use this example. Anytime you’re storing a large amount of
data, especially historical data, you want to be able to look back. For our client
<a href="/case-studies/americasmart.html" class="color-teal hover-color-dark-blue">AmericasMart</a>, their
exhibitors sell products, but they may have also sold different products last year, or two or three years ago. We have
all this historic data warehoused, so AmericasMart can generate reports on who exhibited, when, and where their booth
was located.</p>
<p>After we have your data, we can not only report it back to you, but also
<a href="/capabilities/system-integrations.html" class="color-teal hover-color-dark-blue">share it with third-party applications</a>.
as well.</p>'
