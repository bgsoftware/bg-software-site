title: Back-End Development

subtitle: "It gets no fanfare, but it does all the hard work invisibly."

text: "<p>You store your data somewhere - likely the cloud - and then give users a way to interact with that data
through APIs. That’s the basic gist of back-end. And that’s a skill we have much experience with.</p>
<p>APIs are considered back-end development, the code that runs the server. The API processes a request from a front-end
application (such as a web browser) and leverages its connection to the data store in order to return an https-based
response that's both understood and presented with a browser.</p>
<p>Back-end development is the combination of development and maintenance of core functional logic of a software
application. In simple terms, back-end teams spend lots of time on implementing algorithms to ensure proper
functionality of a website.</p>"
