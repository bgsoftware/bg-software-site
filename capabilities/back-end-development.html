text: "How it works. You store your data somewhere - likely the cloud - and then give users a way to interact with that data through APIs. That’s the basic gist of back-end. APIs are considered back-end development. The code that runs on the back end of the server. The front end runs on a browser. The API makes the call to the back-end. It communicates to the database channel, and other services, like mail or logging servers. It gives data in a specific format that’s both understood and consumable by a browser. The browser makes the call to the API. The API talks to the database or server on the backend. It spits out data in a normal form. Back-End development is the combination of development and maintenance of core functional logic of a software application. In simple terms, backend teams tend to spend more time figuring out logics and implementing algorithms than the web designers, to ensure the website functions properly. It’s the brain of a website. It’s the brain of an app."
