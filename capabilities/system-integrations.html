text: "We have had several clients who needed system integrations support. They typically had an application with a database but later there’s a need to integrate with a third-party piece of software, such as a registration order system or payment portal, and they need access to the data. We have set up numerous APIs to work off their existing database. Easy for us, and the customer only sees the end result – a nightmare avoided. Another example would be if somebody came to us and said, “I have this application and it’s already been built; it’s been running and now I want to take payments on it.” We have experience taking payments for all sorts of things, and then integrating with a bunch of different merchants. We have had clients whose business takes payments, but their system isn’t PCI compliant – that compliance can be expensive. Instead, we set them up with a payment merchant (like authorize.Net, or PayPros) that will take the credit card details. Our client only stores these things called tokens in their system, which can only be used by that system. Simply put: when two things need to talk to each other, we can make that happen."
