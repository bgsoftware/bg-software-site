subtitle: "Taking scattered information and organizing it so it’s easy for you to use."

text: '<p>We have had several clients who needed support for systems integration. They typically had an application
with a <a href="/case-studies/americasmart.html" class="color-teal hover-color-dark-blue">database</a>
but later needed to integrate with a third-party piece of software, such as a registration system, and that third
party needed access to the client’s data. We set up numerous APIs to work off the existing database, automatically
providing the third-party application with up-to-date data when they need it. It’s easy for us, and the customer only
sees the result – a nightmare avoided.</p>
<p>Another example would be if somebody came to us and said, “I have this application and it’s already been built; it’s
been running and now I want to take payments on it.”. We have had clients who wanted to start taking online payments,
but not go through the expensive PCI compliance process. Instead, we set a custom integration with a payment merchant
(like authorize.Net, or PayPros) that will process the credit cards.</p>
<p>Simply put - when two things need to talk to each other, we can make that happen.</p>'
