subtitle: "People really appreciate when you get them out of a tough spot."

text: "<p>Support and Maintenance is a service we offer to all our clients. They appreciate our ability and availability
to help them get out of a tough spot. Sometimes somebody will get themselves in a situation where, “Oh, I thought I
understood how to do this, but after looking into it, I actually don’t. Do you guys have experience in this?
Can you help us out?” We will. We’ll definitely help them with that.</p>
<p>Can someone come to us out of the blue and say, “I totally messed this up, I need this in production next week and
it’s not done.” The answer is probably, though it depends on several things. We are ready to be helpful and look, but
we also don’t over promise. At BG Software, we’re open and honest about what we can do, and we’re always willing to
try.</p>"
