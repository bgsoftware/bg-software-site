subtitle: "It’s developers and operations working together to safely (but quickly) get your code out to your servers."

text: '<p>We do DevOps for all our clients. </p>
<p>Let’s say you have a database, or two, or 300. There’s your security component, (link
to security page), the authentication and authorization system. There’s a session server
to store security information for the user. There’s an API server that accesses the
database and sends the information around. Those are ready to serve for caching. You
might have a bunch of different systems, a bunch of different servers (or containers) of
data. All those things need to come up in a very specific order. DevOps is the process
which ensures that happens.</p>
<p>Or maybe you’re just focused on one piece. Say one of five servers need to be updated.
How do you do that in a way so the other four don’t fail?</p>
<p>Operations sets up the infrastructure. We write your code. Then we test the code. If
any of those tests fails, we go back and fix it. After that, the code moves out to
servers.</p>
<p>Developers do certain things to make the operations team feel good about what they’re
doing. The operations team does certain things to make the developers feel confident in
their work.</p>
<p>The intersection of Agile development and people is DevOps.</p>'
